# Rust API Reference

Welcome to the Brokkr code-level documentation! This section contains the complete, automatically generated Rust API docs for all major Brokkr crates. Here you'll find detailed information on every public type, function, trait, and module in the Brokkr ecosystem.

Use these docs to:
- Explore the internals of Brokkr's core components
- Understand available APIs for integration or extension
- Dive deep into implementation details and type signatures
- Find examples and usage patterns directly from the source
