Here are the main commands:\nDevelopment To serve the documentation locally with live reload:\nangreal docs serve This command will:\nGenerate the Rust API documentation Copy it to the Hugo static directory Start the Hugo development server Open the documentation at http://localhost:1313 Building for Production To build the complete documentation site:\nangreal docs build This will:\nGenerate the Rust API documentation Copy it to the Hugo static directory Build the complete Hugo site Output the site to docs/public/ Troubleshooting If you encounter issues:\nMake sure all prerequisites are installed Check that the Hugo server is running Verify that rustdoc generation is working Check the Hugo server logs for any errors Ensure all paths in api-link shortcodes are correct Make sure your crate name in the shortcodes matches your actual crate name ","description":" API Reference Welcome to the API documentation.
