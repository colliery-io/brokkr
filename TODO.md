# Brokkr Agent TODOs

## High Priority

### Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling with cleanup of in-progress operations
- [ ] Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff for broker communication failures
- [ ] Improve error reporting granularity in deployment object processing
- [ ] Add rollback verification after failed deployments

### Testing
- [ ] Add negative test cases for broker communication failures
- [ ] Add test coverage for concurrent deployment processing
- [ ] Add chaos testing scenarios (network partition, broker unavailability)
- [ ] Test memory usage under load with large YAML deployments
- [ ] Add integration tests for CRD ordering and dependencies


### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - Deployment success/failure rates
  - Processing time per deployment
  - Broker communication latency
  - Memory usage
- [ ] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Add health check endpoint with detailed component status
- [ ] Create dashboard templates for monitoring

## Medium Priority

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Add validation for all configuration parameters
- [ ] Support different logging levels per component
- [ ] Add configuration reload without restart
- [ ] Implement secret rotation mechanism for PAKs


### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple deployment objects
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed k8s resources
- [ ] Optimize memory usage during YAML parsing
- [ ] Add connection pooling for broker communication

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add TLS certificate rotation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for broker API calls
- [ ] Add audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Implement RBAC for different agent roles

## Low Priority

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add dry-run capability for deployments
- [ ] Improve debug logging for deployment processing
- [ ] Create development environment setup script
- [ ] Add more code documentation and examples

### Feature Additions
- [ ] Support for deployment scheduling
- [ ] Add deployment validation webhooks
- [ ] Implement deployment progress reporting
- [ ] Add support for canary deployments


### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor broker module into smaller components
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest versions
- [ ] Remove duplicate code in test fixtures
- [ ] Improve test organization and naming

### Documentation
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Add deployment best practices guide

## Notes
- Priority levels are based on current codebase analysis
- Implementation order should consider dependencies between tasks
- All new features should include corresponding tests
- Consider backwards compatibility when making changes
