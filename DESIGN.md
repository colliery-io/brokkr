# Rust Workspace Design Documentation

#### 1. **`brokkr-models` Crate:**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Define core data structures, traits, and utilities.
     - Include serialization, validation, and any other common traits associated with the models.
   - **Public:** 
     - Expose all models and related traits/utilities for use by other crates.

#### 2. **`brokkr-broker` Crate ):**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Serve as the main application server, exposing HTTP/REST/gRPC endpoints.
     - Implement complex business logic, orchestrating multiple DAO calls.
     - Handle all database interactions, including CRUD operations and data migrations.
     - Coordinate interactions with agents and manage overall system state.
   - **Structure:**
     - **Public:**
       - Expose APIs or endpoints for external interaction, including agents and the admin interface.
       - Provide interfaces for the agents to communicate with the broker.
     - **Private:**
       - **Data Access Layer:** Internal modules for managing database connections, queries, and migrations.
       - **Operations Layer:** Internal business logic modules that orchestrate DAO calls, implement complex logic, and enforce business rules.
       - **Routing/Endpoints:** Internal routing and request handling for the broker's HTTP/REST/gRPC endpoints.
       - **Agent Management:** Internal mechanisms to handle stateful interactions with agents.
       - **Utilities:** Import shared utilities such as configuration management, logging, and error handling from the `brokkr-utils` crate.

#### 3. **`brokkr-agent` Crate:**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Implement agent-specific logic, to apply events to the k8s cluster..
     - Communicate with the broker to determine actions and possibly report status.
   - **Public:**
     - Health and telemetry information only
   - **Private:**
     - Internal logic for agent-specific strategies and decision-making.
     - Utilize shared utilities from the `brokkr-utils` crate for consistency and reusability.

#### 4. **`admin_interface` Crate:**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Provide a TUI/GUI for monitoring and managing the broker, agents, and overall system state.
   - **Public:**
     - Expose the administration interface for user interaction.
   - **Private:**
     - Internal logic for UI rendering, state management, and backend communication.
     - Leverage utilities from the `brokkr-utils` crate, such as logging and configuration management.

#### 5. **`brokkr-utils` Crate:**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Provide common utilities and interfaces that can be shared across the entire workspace to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.
   - **Components:**
     - **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration handling, possibly using libraries like `config` or `serde`, to manage environment variables, configuration files, and runtime settings.
     - **Logging:** A unified logging interface, perhaps based on `log` and `env_logger` or `tracing`, to provide consistent logging across all crates.
     - **Error Handling:** Common error types and error-handling utilities, potentially utilizing crates like `thiserror` or `anyhow` to standardize how errors are managed and propagated.
     - **Utilities:** Additional shared utilities, such as constants, helper functions, and common traits/interfaces that can be used by other crates to avoid code duplication.

### **Summary of Interactions:**
- **`brokkr-models` Crate:** Shared across all other crates, ensuring consistency in data structures.
- **`brokkr-broker` Crate:** Centralizes all server-side functionality, including data access, business logic, and external communication via HTTP/REST/gRPC, while leveraging common utilities from the `brokkr-utils` crate.
- **`brokkr-agent` Crate(s):** Interacts with the broker to perform tasks and make decisions, utilizing shared utilities from the `brokkr-utils` crate.
- **`admin_interface` Crate:** Interfaces with the broker and possibly agents to provide monitoring and control features, making use of utilities from the `brokkr-utils` crate.
- **`brokkr-utils` Crate:** Provides a set of common utilities (configuration management, logging, error handling, etc.) used by the broker, agents, and administration interface to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy across the workspace.
